# The-Smart-Contract-Wallet

Did you get pocket money as a kid? Maybe your parents tried to teach you an important lesson on how to spend money wisely. Or maybe you have a business credit card and can have a certain amount of expenses on it per day and month. In this project we're going to have a look at a smart wallet. A smart contract that can manage its own funds and limit how much can be spent.

The implementation of the Smart Contract Wallet:
These are the requirements:

1. The wallet has one owner
2. The wallet should be able to receive funds, no matter what
3. It is possible for the owner to spend funds on any kind of address, no matter if its a so-called Externally Owned Account (EOA - with a private key), or a Contract Address.
4. It should be possible to allow certain people to spend up to a certain amount of funds.
5. It should be possible to set the owner to a different address by a minimum of 3 out of 5 guardians, in case funds are lost.
